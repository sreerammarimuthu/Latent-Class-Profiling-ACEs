## Abstract  

Latinos in the United States (US) are disproportionately affected by Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and experience greater ACE-related consequences, including alcohol and drug use problems. However, research on ACEs has been limited by three methodological constraints: a lack of inclusion of racial/ethnic diverse participants, including Latinos; a large focus on family-level ACEs (e.g., maltreatment, household dysfunction) that typically overlooks community-level ACEs (e.g., community violence, discrimination); and a reliance on cumulative risk scores that obscure the impact of specific adversity patterns. To address these gaps, this study sought to identify latent patterns of family- and community-level ACEs and their distinct associations with alcohol and drug misuse among Latino university students. Latent class analysis (LCA) of data from N = 2,865 participants identified four distinct ACE classes: Low Adversity, Household Dysfunction, Polyvictimization, and High Adversity. While US-born status and cisgender female identity were associated with the High Adversity and Household Dysfunction classes, sexual minority identity was the only demographic characteristic associated with increased risk of membership across all three ACE classes: Household Dysfunction (OR=1.37), Polyvictimization (OR=2.81), and High Adversity (OR=5.29). Regression models revealed unique associations. Those in the High Adversity (OR=1.80) and Polyvictimization (OR=1.78) classes had higher odds of hazardous drinking. Household Dysfunction class was most strongly linked to Low-Risk Drug Use (OR=2.33), while Polyvictimization conferred the highest risk for Problematic Drug Use (OR=6.46). These findings demonstrate that a person-centered analysis of expanded ACEs is critical for revealing specific risk pathways and developing targeted clinical screening and public health interventions.
